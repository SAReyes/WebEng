WebSockets
======

To-do tasks service, WebSocket approach.
This was implemented using Play Framework 2.3.7 with activator running sbt 0.13.5.

This service syncs all the clients to receive real-time updates of the service.
* To run the service run the command `activator run` and the service will run at localhost:9000 by default

Disclaimer: This project has an educational porpuse, it does not intend to solve a real world problem but to teach how to implement a simple WebSocket service in Play using Akka actors
