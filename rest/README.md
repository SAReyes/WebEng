REST
======

To-do tasks service, RESTful approach.
This was implemented using Play Framework 2.3.7 with activator running sbt 0.13.5
* To run the service run the command `activator run` and the service will run at localhost:9000 by default
* To test the service run the command `activator test`

Disclaimer: This project has an educational porpuse, it does not intend to solve a real world problem but to teach how to implement a simple REST service in Play
